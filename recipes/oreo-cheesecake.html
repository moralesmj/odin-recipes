        <li>Beat in eggs, 1 at a time, until just blended.</li>
        <li>Chop remaining 8 cookies; gently stir 1/2 of the chopped cookies into cream cheese batter.</li>
        <li>Pour over prepared crust; sprinkle remaining chopped cookies on top.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until center is just set, about 45 minutes.</li>
